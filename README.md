# Evaluation of Approaches to Committing Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (cAEAD)
The code for my Cyber Security MSc dissertation.

> **Note**
> 
> I have spent nearly every day working on this project (primarily writing the document) for 3-4 months. It has been very time pressured, and I am well aware of its flaws. It is possible some proposals and implementations are insecure or incorrect. Some implementations are also suboptimal in terms of performance, and there were issues and mistakes running the benchmarks. If I could go back, I would do several things differently or perhaps even choose a different topic. At this point, I am just glad it is over, although I read a lot of interesting things along the way.
